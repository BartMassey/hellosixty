# hellosixty: Sixty FPS Rust "Hello GUI" Demo
Bart Massey 2021

This small demo of the [Sixty FPS](http://sixtyfps.io) GUI
framework [Rust bindings](http://crates.io/crates/sixtyfps)
does a standard "Hello GUI" task: providing an incrementable
displayed counter via program interaction.

The code shows receiving button callbacks from the GUI and
updating the GUI's counter text, as well as simple (very
simple) layout.
